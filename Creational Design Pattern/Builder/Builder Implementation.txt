Builder Implementation Steps  (for future refrences)

1 Identify the "parts" of the product & provide methods to create those parts.

2 It should provide a method to "assemble" or build the product/object

3 It must provide a way/method to get fully object out.
Optionally builder can keep reference to an product it has built so the same can be returned again in future
