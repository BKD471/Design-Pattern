Interface Segregation

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.

In more common words this is called, Interface Pollution.
We should not make interfaces bigger, that is do not stuff your interfaces with more and more unrelated abstract methods
and force all the classes that implements those interfaces to implement those methods even though that class has no purpose/intention to provide implementation of that particular method methods.

In other words, all abstract methods declared in Interfaces should be cohesive and related to each other 
and classes implementing that interface ,should not be forced to implement any method that does not serve its purpose

Easy to find if InterFace Segregation is violated or not is to find  whether any class is providing a dummy/empty implementation of a method
or the method implementation is returning null or dummy values.
or lookout for those methods that throw UnsupportedOperationException
